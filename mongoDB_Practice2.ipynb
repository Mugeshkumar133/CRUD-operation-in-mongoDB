This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities.\"},\n",

It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \\nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \\nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \\nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option.

It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \\r\\n\\r\\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"},\n",

The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks).\"},\n",

              "    'comments': 'This rental was the first time I’ve rented lodging from Airbnb. \\n\\nI’m giving the review three stars instead of one star because of two reasons, \\nDavid, the property manager, and the location, in Waikiki. \\n\\nDavid is a very nice man who listened to our concerns and acted to help out as much as he could.  David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\\n\\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \\n\\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\\n\\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again.'},\n",
